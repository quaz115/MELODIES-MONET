Supported Datasets
==================

Supported Models and Observations are below. Please see
:ref:`Adding New Datasets <develop/datasets:Adding New Datasets>`
for advice on how to add new model and observational datasets to MELODIES MONET.

Supported Models
----------------

   * `CMAQ <https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/>`_
   * `WRF-Chem <https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/>`_
   * `CESM/CAM-chem <https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/gcm/cam-chem>`_
   * `RRFS-CMAQ (under development) <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Air-Quality-Modeling>`_ 
   * `RAQMS <http://raqms-ops.ssec.wisc.edu/>`_
   
In general, processing requires input to be in netCDF format. For the above 
models, scripts to configure the model data into a standard format for 
MELODIES MONET are available. If input datasets are in netCDF format and  
define latitude, longitude, altitude, and a datetime object, MELODIES MONET may be able 
to directly read the input files.

project on GitHub to learn about current and future development.
